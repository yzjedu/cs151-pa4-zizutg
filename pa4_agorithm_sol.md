### Algorithm for `get_menu_option`
- **Purpose**: Display menu options and get a valid menu option from the user.
- **Name**: `get_menu_option`
- **Parameters**: None
- **Return**: A valid menu option as an integer (1 to 7).
- **Algorithm**:
  1. Display the menu options:
      - 1. Count headlines containing a specific word.
      - 2. Write headlines with a specific word to a new file.
      - 3. Calculate average headline length.
      - 4. Find the longest headlines.
      - 5. Find the shortest headlines.
      - 6. Load a new file.
      - 7. Quit.
